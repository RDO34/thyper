# thyper

A minimalist typing practice tool in the terminal.

## Installation

First ensure [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is installed and up to date.

Then install `thyper` with cargo:

```sh 
cargo install thyper
```

## Usage

To run in normal mode, simply run:

```sh
thyper
```

To run in quick mode (no menus), use the `--quick` or `-q` flag:


```sh
thyper -q
```

To just print out scores (personal best, average), use the `--scores` or `-s` flag:

```sh
thyper -s
```

That's it!
